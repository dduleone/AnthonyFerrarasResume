## Recommendation

Anthony is a World Class Engineer. This cannot be overstated, and his professional achievements are worthy of this being the first thing someone says about him. But more than that, he is a World Class Engineer who attracts other World Class Engineers, at least in part because of his ability to create new World Class Engineers.

Anthony has always had a firm commitment to technical excellence. He is patient and thorough when working with stakeholders and subordinates, and he makes everyone around him better. His attention to detail, the pace at which he develops solutions, the depth to which his curiosity and research skills compel him, and the candor with which he works through ideas have consistently served as inspiration during the most successful years of my career. I have witnessed firsthand how Anthony's ethics and integrity, combined with the respect he commands and the quality he delivers, have empowered him to foster healthy cultures and inspire teams to produce a sum that is greater than their parts.

I have seen his impact be transformational. I have seen him teach engineers to believe in themselves and reach for higher goals. And I have seen his poise both in times of stress and times of celebration. I'd be delighted at the opportunity to work under Anthony again, and I'd be privileged to have him dedicated to building a solution of my own conception. Anthony accomplishes what he sets out to accomplish, delivers the results he promises, and along the way reminds the people he works with that integrity and compassion are still virtues that accelerate performance and empower the best talent to flourish.

## What is your most memorable accomplishment together

With Anthony providing technical guidance and being the only veteran engineer on the project, for my first assignment at NBCUniversal, our team of rookie engineers completed the first in-house project that delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule.

## Biggest Strengths

In no particular order, Anthony's biggest strengths are

- His broad technical experience and expertise
- His technical prowess, and creative problem solving
- His ability to understand business needs, and deliver iterative value
- His infallible integrity and compassion, which make him well respected by subordinates and peers

## Biggest Weaknesses

Anthony's greatest weakness is the passion that drives him to go above and beyond, occasionally to his own detriment. And sometimes, he forgets that not everyone can move at the speed he moves.

## Advice for future employers

Hire Anthony, set reasonable expectations, and then give him the autonomy to deliver a happy team of engineers, who consistently achieve your business's goals.

## What type of work environment do you think Anthony will most likely thrive in?

One with optimistic engineers, dedicated to technical excellence, who are solving interesting problems, providing meaningful value, and willing to implement ever-evolving industry best practices.

## Would you work with/for Anthony again?

Unequivocally. I've developed into the type of engineer who helps others grow. But I've never grown faster or more consistently, than when working with Anthony. So long as I aspire to be a better engineer, there's no one else I'd rather have leading my team.
